I would like to categorize myself as close to Machine learning engineering than any other job description. On a day to day basis, I code in Python, Java, Javascript. If I can define what I can do, it would be

*   Build Machine learning (Regression, Time series analysis, Random forest) & Deep learning(CNN - Image Processing) models
*   Build backend features in Django (Python), Node (JS), Play (Java). I mainly work on building features that are required from the Data science front.
*   Build simple web apps using React, Vanilla JS

I completed my bachelor’s in 2013 in Electronics & Communications. Post that i have worked for last 6 years with companies like [Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com/), [MuSigma](https://www.mu-sigma.com/) & [SigTuple](https://www.sigtuple.com/). I started my career as a Business analyst later transitioning into development then into data science.
